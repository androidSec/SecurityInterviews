Security Questions
==================

Cryptography
------------

* What’s the difference between encoding, encryption, and hashing?

* How should you safely store a password?

* What’s the difference between symmetric and public-key (asymmetric) cryptography?
* What are some scenarios where one is more appropriate then the other?

* What’s the difference between diffie-hellman and RSA?
	Diffie-Hellman is a key-exchange protocol, and RSA is an encryption/signing protocol. RSA requires you to have key material beforehand, DH does not.
* What kind of attack is a standard diffie-hellman exchange vulnerable to?
	MITM

* How do you safely generate a random number?
* What's wrong with your standard RNG?

* Describe HMAC in detail.

* Describe encryption modes, CTR, ECB, CBC, GCM.

* What's good and bad about TOFU?

* How do collisions in hash functions affect security (in theory and in practice)?

* Should you authenticate then encrypt, or encrypt then authenticate or encrypt and authenticate at the same time? Why?
	Encrypt and then authenticate, because otherwise you'll have to decrypt before checking the authenticity of the plaintext. This has caused all sorts of problems with, for example, SSL, leading to POODLE, Lucky13, BEAST, CRIME and other acronyms. See https://moxie.org/blog/the-cryptographic-doom-principle/ for more information.

DNS
---
* How does DNS work?
* When does DNS use TCP?
	DNS goes over TCP when the size of the request or the response is greater than a single packet such as with responses that have many records or many IPv6 responses or most DNSSEC responses. Some resolver implementations use TCP for all queries.
* How does a DNS Amplification Attack work?
	Open Recursion + Amplification = DDoS on Steroids

	ANY requests normally give the biggest response, so they're typically used.
* What are some different DNS record types and when are they used?
* What do you have to worry about when running your own DNS servers?
* How can you use DNS for instrusion detection?
	https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/office365security/dns-intrusion-detection-in-office-365/
* How many root servers are there?

Infrastructure Security
-----------------------

* How do you bootstrap trust amongst hosts?
* How do you handle SSH host keys?
* ssh(1) warns you about a hostkey fingerprint mismatch. What do you do? (No, be honest.) How do you solve this problem?
* What are the top 3 things you do to improve a system's security?
* How do you manage / utilize shared jumpboxes in your environment? What are some of the implications and pitfalls of having them?
* Are there alternatives to storing passwords?
* Why should or shouldn't you have . (dot) in your PATH?
* Explain how SSH tunneling / port forwarding works. What are some pitfalls or risks?
* How does sudo(1) work? What are common related pitfalls?
* What is the difference in permissions on a directory that is mode 0777 and one that is mode 1777?
	The 1 is what is called the sticky bit. A directory whose sticky bit is set becomes an append-only directory, or, more accurately, a directory in which the deletion of files is restricted. A file in a sticky directory may only be removed or renamed by a user if the user has write permission for the directory and the user is the owner of the file, the owner of the directory, or the super-user.

* How does ASAN work?
* How does UBSAN work?


Miscellaneous
-------------
* Why did you leave your last job?
* Have you ever worked with someone you disliked before?
* Why are you interested in working at Company?
* Have you ever used the product before?
* Describe what happens when you type www.google.com and hit Enter?
* What type of work environment would you dislike and why?
* What kind of work do you enjoy the most and why?
* If you had unlimited time and money and could work on anything, what would you work on?
* Describe your past relationships with other engineering teams.
* Have you ever had to stop an engineer from pushing code that had security issues?
* Where do you see yourself in 5 years?
* Open ended threat modeling questions.
	Maybe read https://www.amazon.com/Threat-Modeling-Designing-Adam-Shostack/dp/1118809998 but if you're a competent security professional these should be the easier part of the interview.

Web Security
------------
* How do you approach assessing a web application?
* What is CSRF?
	CSRF stands for cross-site request forgery, it is when an attacker makes a victim's browser make request that takes an action on behalf of the user without their knowledge, say /change_password?pw=foo and the victims password is changed without their knowledge.
* Can you CSRF a POST request?
	Sure, via hidden form-fields. You'd have to make the user click a button to send the request, perhaps a 'click here to win a million bucks' button. 
* How do you mitigate CSRF?
	Create a token 

	There is also the newer way of marking cookies as Same-Site, but it's only supported on the latest browser versions.

* Can you put the CSRF token in a cookie header?
* If the CSRF token isn't sent automatically, how does it get sent back and forth each time by legitimate code?
* What is bad about the double-submit mitigation?
* How do you fake a Referer header?

* What is XSS?
* How do you mitigate XSS?
	Input validation and output sanitization, with focus on the latter.

* What is an open-redirect?
* How do you mitigate open-redirects?

* What is SSRF?

* What is an origin?
* What is CORS?
* What are some examples of application level DoS and how do you mitigate them?

* What can you do with Burp Suite?

* How does OAuth work?
* How does SAML work?

* Your login process requires a password. Talk about the UI decisions around this. What tradeoffs do you make between password complexity requirements and usability? How do you design the user feedback for repeatedly entered wrong passwords?

*What is SSL and why is it not enough when it comes to encryption?

SSL is identity verification, not hard data encryption. It is designed to be able to prove that the person you are talking to on the other end is who they say they are. SSL and its big brother TLS are both used almost everyone online, but the problem is because of this it is a huge target and is mainly attacked via its implementation (The Heartbleed bug for example) and its known methodology. As a result, SSL can be stripped in certain circumstances, so additional protections for data-in-transit and data-at-rest are very good ideas.

* What are salted hashes?

Salt at its most fundamental level is random data. When a properly protected password system receives a new password, it will create a hashed value for that password, create a new random salt value, and then store that combined value in its database. This helps defend against dictionary attacks and known hash attacks. For example, if a user uses the same password on two different systems, if they used the same hashing algorithm, they could end up with the same hash value. However, if even one of the systems uses salt with its hashes, the values will be different.
